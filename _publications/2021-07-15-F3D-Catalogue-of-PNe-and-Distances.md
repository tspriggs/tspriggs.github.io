This paper is presents the catalogue of Planetary Nebulae, as detected within 21 of the Early Type Galaxies of the Foranx cluster. The catalogue comprises of 1350 unique sources, including their line-of-sight-velocities, \[OIII] magnitudes and locations in RA and DEC. We also present distances to each galaxy, measured directly from the PN luminosity function. We calculate an average distance to Fornax cluster of 19.84 +/- 0.32 Mpc.
