Due to my knowledge of the Linux command line, I was asked to help teach tutorials in Cyber-Security Penetration Testing. My favourite achievement was introducing the vim text editor, and no one asked how to exit vim. I learnt a lot from this class, both to better deliver the material, and to feed my curiosity round Penetration testing.
